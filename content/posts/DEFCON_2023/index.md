# Defcon
While this post does not contain any specific information regarding the challenges, I wanted to mention here that I played in this year's Defcon Qualifiers.

It was a lot of fun, and I learned a lot. In particular, I learned about how programs are linked together at compile time to form an elf binary, as well as some of the cool things c programs can do! 

I am looking forward to playing again next year, hopefully after I get better at reverse engineering!

Our team placed 15th and the top 12 teams qualify :(
